Does anyone know why that is? It's a tradition left over from Porsche's racing history. The world's greatest endurance race is the 24 Hours of LeMans. Which is in France and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on Saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on Sunday. In the 60s LeMans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track. At the start of the race, the drivers would run across the track, get in the car, buckle up, start the car, and drive off. Porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took. Since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel, that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat-belts, put the car in gear and start it. The driver's left hand did nothing. Porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24-hour race; moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat-belts with his right hand. That's why every Porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel.}","tokens_with_note":[["{","Transcriber","'s","Note","She","puts","the","key","into","the","ignition",",","which","is","on","the","left","side","of","the","steering","wheel","."],["Does","anyone","know","why","that","is","?"],["It","'s","a","tradition","left","over","from","Porsche","'s","racing","history","."],["The","world","'s","greatest","endurance","race","is","the","24","Hours","of","LeMans","."],["Which","is","in","France","and","runs","for","24","hours","straight","from","noon","on","Saturday","through","the","dark","of","night","and","finishes","at","noon","on","Sunday","."],["In","the","60s","LeMans","had","a","unique","start","where","the","drivers","would","actually","start","the","race","outside","of","the","car","and","across","the","track","."],["At","the","start","of","the","race",",","the","drivers","would","run","across","the","track",",","get","in","the","car",",","buckle","up",",","start","the","car",",","and","drive","off","."],["Porsche","wanted","to","reduce","the","amount","of","time","that","took","."],["Since","all","cars","to","that","point","had","the","ignition","switches","on","the","right","side","of","the","steering","wheel",",","that","required","the","drivers","to","use","their","right","hand","to","grab","the","seat","-","belts",",","put","the","car","in","gear","and","start","it","."],["The","driver","'s","left","hand","did","nothing","."],["Porsche","in","order","to","save","a","few","seconds","in","a","24","-","hour","race",";","moved","the","ignition","switches","to","the","left","side","of","the","steering","wheel","so","that","the","driver","could","start","the","car","with","his","left","hand","while","grabbing","the","seat","-","belts","with","his","right","hand","."],["That","'s","why","every","Porsche","car","built","since","then","has","the","ignition","on","the","left","side","of","the","steering","wheel","."],["}"]]},{"utteranceId":"s07_e22_c04_u010","speakers":["Ross Geller"],"transcript":"No ah-ah-ah!
