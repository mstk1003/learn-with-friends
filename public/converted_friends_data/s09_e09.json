It's just that . . . well, I'm wearing the same thing underneath. So . . . MONICA: Oh. CHANDLER: See what I mean . . . (They kiss.) (There is a loud thud at the door.) JOEY: Hey! How come the door's locked? MONICA: Just a second. CHANDLER: (hushed) No, no, no, no, no. Joey can't know that I'm here. MONICA: Why not? CHANDLER: Because I didn't know how to tell him that I couldn't go to the Knicks game. So, I just told him that I had to stay in Tulsa. MONICA: So, you lied to him? CHANDLER: Achhh. It's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion. (pause) Except with you. JOEY: Hey! Open the door. What's going on? (He knocks.) (Monica goes to the door. Chandler slides behind it as she opens it slightly.) JOEY: What are you . .. (He sees her in her negligee.) Why are you dressed like that? MONICA: Oh, because, um . . . well, Chandler's going to be home in a couple of days. So, I thought I would, you know, practice the art of seduction. JOEY: Oh, I thought I heard a man's voice before. MONICA: Oh I was just doing Chandler's side of the conversation. You know, like, \"Hi, How do I look?\" (As Chandler) \"Really sexy. Could I BE any more turned on?\" JOEY: Okay. (pause. He looks over her shoulder at the table with the wine.) Whoa, whoa. Why are there two glasses of wine out? MONICA: Because. . . one of them is for you. (Monica turns to get the wine. Chandler peeps through the peephole. Joey, seeing something, peeps back. Chandler ducks. Monica returns with two glasses of wine. She gives one to Joey.) MONICA: Cheers. (She clinks his glass and pulls back.) Okay, buh-bye. (She closes the door.) CHANDLER: You know, it's funny. I've been, ah, practicing the art of seduction myself. (He raises his hands in front of himself, sticks out his behind, and wiggles it.) Hi ya. MONICA: You might want to keep practicing. CHANDLER: Yah. (Chandler's cell phone rings. He looks at it.) CHANDLER: It's Joey. (He answers it, holding it out so that Monica can hear too.) Hey Joe. JOEY: Dude, come home! CHANDLER: What? Why? JOEY: COME . . . HOME. CHANDLER: Look I, I can't. What's going on? JOEY: I don't know how to tell you this but, uh . . . I think Monica's cheatin' on ya. I told you shouldn't have married someone so much hotter than you. (Chandler and Monica look at each other. Chandler nods.) JOEY: All right look. (He walks to the hallway.) If you can't come home and deal with this, then I'm gonna. CHANDLER: NO!

JOEY: I heard him again! CHANDLER: (writhes as if in agony) All right, look. Just stay there. I'm coming home. JOEY: Okay. Great. I'll see you when you get here. I'm gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out. CHANDLER: Is that really necessary? JOEY: Absolutely. You'd do it for me. Not that you ever have to because I know how to keep my women satisfied.[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment. Mike is blowing a note from his beer bottle. Ross stares off to the side.) ROSS: Shouldn't the pizza be here by now? I mean, they said thirty minutes or less. Well, how long has it been? MIKE: (looking at his watch) Eleven minutes. (long pause) And now twelve. So, do you like the beer? ROSS: I do. I do. Although, it's actually a lager. MIKE: huh. (pause) What's the difference between beer and lager? ROSS: I don't know. We could look it up.
